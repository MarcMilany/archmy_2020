magic-af
========

magic-af is a zsh theme based on the af-magic theme, with a few custom
changes based on the avit theme. Essentially, the changes just make the
af-magic theme play better with my terminal color scheme and "ls" / tab
complete colors.

Installing
----------

1. Clone the repo, or download the magic-af.zsh-theme file
2. Copy the magic-af.zsh-theme to the oh-my-zsh/themes/ directory
(By default ```~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/```)
3. Edit the ```.zshrc``` file to set the ZSH_THEME to magic-af: ```ZSH_THEME="magic-af"```
